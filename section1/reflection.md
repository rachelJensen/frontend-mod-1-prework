## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I appreciated the general theme of the article which I think was about keeping a curious, open mind. In particular, I already read widely--well, specifically I *listen* to a lot nonfiction audiobooks and podcasts and read a lot of fiction. Likewise, I have process/growth oriented way of thinking and relating to the world. And I eat a pretty vegetable heavy diet, though that has more to do with wanting to feel good in my body than in taking care of a brain, though both are important.

I could definitely benefit from taking shorter breaks more often. I need to work on finding my sweet-spot ratio of focus-to-break time. I tend to get very intensely focused and forget to take breaks, and then when I do break I want to walk away for a long time which I will not have the luxury of doing in this program. It also helps me to have a specific activity to do in the break time, like a step in the laundry process or making a cup of coffee. I also want to be sure that while coding is going to have to be the dominant interest of my life for the next seven months, I don't want to lose of sight of my broader interests, so making sure that podcasts still get listened to and fiction still gets read (at least a little).

Finally, I would add to this SuperLearner list the value of sleep and prayer/meditation. Both prime the mind to be flexible and to respond with less stress when challenges arise.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

**Numbers:** a data type that is a number. Includes positive and negative integers and floating decimals
**Booleans:** a piece of data that *evaluate* to be either true or false. This can be a comparison whether one number is greater or less than another, or if they are equal/not equal. It can also compare string values using the Unicode standards which are close to, but not exactly like, alphabetic ordering in a dictionary.
**String:** a data type that is made up of letters or other characters within '' or "" or ``

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log('Hello World!');

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

You can use // for a single line comment, or for a longer section you can use /**/, where anything that goes between the two asterisks is commented out. Code comments are an important way to record what a line or block of code does. It's useful for communicating with other people who might be working with your code, and for reminding yourself what you did or why

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is like a drawer that you can put one pice of information in. You give the variable a name and you assign a piece of information to it. That information might be any of the data types mentioned in question 3, or it can be other things like functions or collections of information called objects.
***

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I use a list app all the time. Some variables it might use could be individual lists which are objects (or arrays). Each list allows you to add items, which are probably strings like 'potatoes' or 'tofu'. It also uses a variable for quantity that would be a number.
***

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is the combining of two or more strings into one string. If a number is concatenated to a string, the number is converted to a string so that the result of the concat is a string.
***

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

My Nike Run Club app is probably using concatenation when it autofills the name of a run, which combines the day of the week and time of day of the run into a title for the recorded activity.
***

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

Why wouldn't you want to use the deeply equals/does not equal (=== or !===) all the time? From a very limited experience it seems like using == or != leaves dangerous wiggle room in code that could betray if you if not used with extreme care.

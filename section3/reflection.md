## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- I really resonated with the parallel to sports that was shared in the podcast. To get better at running or roller skating, I have to do it (or something to support it) everyday. Some days it goes smoothly and I feel great. Other days it feels like a struggle. Both are signs of progress.
- in the same vein, I appreciated the idea that some days are fixed mindset days, where it's hard to feel like I'm ever going to 'get it.' When that happens or I feel super stuck, it can be okay to recognize that today feels fixed, but tomorrow's a new day and I can try again, hopefully with a growth mindset.
- It's not new to me, but it is a good reminder: a growth mindset requires me to seek challenges. With sports I'm good at this--identifying small growth edges to work on day by day, whether it's a slightly longer distance or a new trick. With intellectual challenges, like learning coding, there's more fear and more resistance. I need to remind myself regularly to seek the challenges (hopefully, developmentally appropriate challenges) that keep me growing.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I strive to learn from mistakes and I'm fairly comfortable getting feedback. I'm also good at identifying and constantly applying small challenges to *some* aspects of my life, like roller skating and skiing.
- I need to be better at seeking out challenges in things that scare me (like coding).

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- Spotify is using arrays all over the place, I assume. All the playlists, podcast episode lists, lists of artists by genre, list of albums by a certain artist, and so on.
- Sprouts website is probably using arrays for inventory as well as what I put in my shopping cart, and what it tells the employee to put in my delivery after I've placed an order. [This is a very pandemic answer]

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- An array method is a function that is designed to be used with arrays. Examples include .length (tells the length of an array), .push (adds items to the end of an array), or .pop (removes last item from an array).

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- The purpose of a loop is simplify an repetitive bit of code so that it doesn't have to be written and run a bunch of times manually.
- You might use a loop with an array if you want your program to do something with each item in an array, like check it for a conditional, or concatinate it with a message to be logged
- You might use a loop without an array if there's a specific bit of code you want run a certain number of times.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- Let's say you want to make a valentine for each one of your friends and you have a bunch of paper and crayon. You take the first paper, draw a big heart, and write one friend's name in it, then you put it in a pile. You take the next piece of paper, draw a big heart, write another friend's name inside, and add it to the pile. You do this until you've made a valentine for everyone. Each time you made a valentine you were looping through the same activity. You kept looping until you'd made all the valentines you needed, then you stopped and the loop ended.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- How are huge arrays managed? It's easy to create an array with a few items, but in all the app examples I can think of the arrays are enormous. I'm guessing JavaScript has ways to reach into other type of files to extract data to generate arrays, but I'm curious how that works.
